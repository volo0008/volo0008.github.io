            <h3>About Me:</h3>
            <p>So, I am an international student. I've arrived to Canada for the 1<sup>st</sup> time in my life this month.
                Nature here reminds me my hometown: also very snowy, but not as cold as it is in Ontario.
                I prefer a warmer climate, that is why my destination goal is European Union. 
                There are <strong>27</strong>countries in <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. 
                I've never been to France, Spain or Italy. 
                I would love to go there once I graduate, <em>hopefully</em>.
            </p>
            <p>My understanding of Github is very little, unfortunately. I only used <q>Brackets</q> a little bit long time ago.
                The information must sit for awhile, settle down in my head.
                I am doing my best not to freak out. Although it is nice to know how to make a web page from skretch.
                Not every designer knows how to do it. The outlook is pretty good. 
                I hope creating websites using all these portals, softwares will be a lot easier for me eventually. 
                So I'm gonna try.
