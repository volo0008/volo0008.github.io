            <h3 class="about">About Me:</h3>
            <p>So, I am an international student. I've arrived to Canada for the 1<sup>st</sup> time in my life this month.
                Nature here reminds me my hometown: also very snowy, but not as cold as it is in Ontario.
                I prefer a warmer climate, that is why my destination goal is European Union. 
                There are <strong>27 countries </strong> in <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. 
                I've never been to France, Spain or Italy. 
                I would love to go there once I graduate, <em>hopefully</em>.

            <h3 class="experience">My experience in Github, Web design:</h3>
            <p>My understanding of Github is very little, unfortunately. I only used <q>Brackets</q> a little bit long time ago.
                The information must sit for awhile, settle down in my head.
                I am doing my best not to freak out. Although it is nice to know how to make a web page from skretch.
                Not every designer knows how to do it. <strong>The outlook is pretty good</strong>. 
                I hope creating websites using all these portals, softwares will be a lot easier for me eventually. 
                So I'm gonna try. 
            </p>

            <h3 class="hobbies">My hobbies</h3>
                <p>When I do not take pictures of animals, I take pictures of plants. So my favorite photos depict my hobbies:
                </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Flowers, plants, trees</li>
                <li>Animals</li>
                <li>Obviously, photography</li>
                <li>Many more...</li>
            </ol>
